# What is GitHub?

Remote source code repository hosting with an eye towards _social interaction_.

GitHub is for showing people what you made out of code.

# Forking on GitHub
## GitHub fosters the distributed nature of Git

Forking is the action of cloning someone else's repository and moving it to your
workspace where it can be modified in any way you like.

A forked repository contains **all repository history** while retaining a
conceptual link to the source repository.

If you don't like the way something works, you can fork it, then change it in
any way you like. When the original author makes changes you can use Git to
merge their changes back into your fork.

# Less drunk, more smart

Kind of like Facebook or Twitter, you can **follow users**. But instead of
finding out how drunk they are, you get to see **the cool shit they're making**.

Smart people are making crazy stuff on a continuous basis -- now you can see it
as they make it.

Plus your mom won't try to friend you here.

# Watch the future

favorite frameworks and libraries as they happen.
